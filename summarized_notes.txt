Key Points:
1. Coral reefs are fragile and important ecosystems, supporting diverse marine life and providing economic benefits through tourism.
2. Ecotourism, defined as responsible travel to natural areas, aims to conserve the environment and benefit local communities, but can also pose a threat to coral reefs if not managed properly.
3. Recreational activities such as diving, boating, fishing, and cruises can harm coral reefs through physical damage, pollution, and overexploitation of marine resources.
4. Coral reefs are facing major stress and degradation from human impacts, with 24% at imminent risk of collapse and 26% under a longer-term threat.
5. Sedimentation, caused by coastal development and watershed clearing, is a significant contributor to coral reef destruction.
6. Overuse, direct damage, and ill-considered tourist operations can lead to coral stress, bleaching, and ultimately death of coral reefs.
7. Individual actions, such as avoiding touching living coral, reducing waste, and choosing eco-friendly accommodations, can help mitigate the negative impact of recreational activities on coral reefs.

Important Concepts:
- Coral reefs are valuable ecosystems that support biodiversity and economic benefits through tourism.
- Ecotourism can be both beneficial and harmful to coral reefs depending on proper management.
- Recreational activities can harm coral reefs through physical damage, pollution, and overexploitation of marine resources.
- Human impacts such as sedimentation and coral stress contribute to the degradation of coral reefs.
- Individual actions can play a role in protecting coral reefs by practicing responsible behavior and choosing sustainable travel options.
